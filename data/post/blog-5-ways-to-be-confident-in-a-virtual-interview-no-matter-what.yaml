  - para: Always maintain a good posture when attending any interview since a good posture shows that you are attentive, interested, and participating in the conversation.
  - para: Be yourself. One of the best ways to boost your confidence is to simply be yourself. Relax and be genuine – the interviewer will appreciate it.

  - para: Before your interview, take some time to read up on the company’s history, culture, and values. You can also visit their website and social media accounts to get a better sense of what they’re all about. In addition, research the role you’re applying for – read the job description carefully and see if there are any skills or experience requirements that you can highlight in your interview.

  - para: If you’ve never done a virtual interview before, it’s important to make sure that you’re comfortable with the platform that will be used for the meeting. Most often, virtual interviews are conducted via video call using platforms like Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, Webex or Zoom.
  - para: Before your interview, take some time to familiarise yourself with the platform that will be used. Test out your video and audio settings to make sure everything is working properly. In addition, make sure you have a quiet and well-lit space set up for the call. By taking care of these technical details in advance, you’ll be able to focus on the actual interview and ace it with ease.
