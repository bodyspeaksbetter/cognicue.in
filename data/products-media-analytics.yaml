  text: Measuring the emotions and engagement of the consumer is not new in the Media world. Earlier there were Psychologists to identify that through various questionnaire and psychometric tests, but now, we have the access to technology we can get the access to fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), EEG (electro-encephalogram), Eye tracking(gaze, pupillometry), Biometrics and Facial coding. Our FACS measures and registers the voluntary and involuntary movements of facial muscles. The user when viewing the media would be flashing a set of expressions which are identified by our system. And at the end of the media, it will capture the facial movements and release a report containing the relevant and requested details.
