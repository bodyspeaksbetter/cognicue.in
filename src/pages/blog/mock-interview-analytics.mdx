## CogniCueâ€™s Mock Interview Analytics

Our Mock Interview Analytics solution, provides candidates with an  accurate & detailed report by targeting & analysing their facial movements (voluntary & involuntary), micro expressions & emotions, so that with every mock interview, candidate gets 10 steps closer to his dream company & can express himself in the best manner possible.

## Difference between Traditional Mock Interviews & Mock Interview Analytics

Before mock interviews were data-driven, candidates e.g. IAS aspirants used to give mock interviews only to the institutions having such facility, where 2-3 highly experienced professionals would take the interview in-person, which was not easily available to everyone & thus resulting in it being highly expensive & slightly inaccessible. But, with Mock Interview Analytics as a SaaS platform, anyone located in the remotest part of the world, can take part in the highly accurate & data-backed interviews & improve themselves significantly using the detailed analytical reports.

## Benefits of Mock Interview Analytics

Mock Interview Analytics, not only determines the abilities & the level of preparation of a candidate, but it also describes the intensity of attention, throughout the interview. It enlists the key distraction moments & pinpoints the nonverbal cues having an altogether bad impact on the recruits. The software, being completely unbiased, puts forth all the shortcomings in a very straightforward manner, thus empowering the candidate with deep insights & provides a great opportunity for self-introspection, so that candidate can get rid of all the conscious/subconscious mistakes he/she has been committing right from the start with ease & in the best of his impression.
